A visual placeholder for an element that is loading.

```jsx live
<Skeleton height={334} width="100%">
  <rect height="180" rx="4" ry="4" width="100%" x="0" y="0" />
  <rect height="15" rx="0" ry="0" width="90%" x="0" y="200" />
  <rect height="15" rx="0" ry="0" width="90%" x="0" y="225" />
</Skeleton>
```

## Usage

When you need to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) or provide a visual placeholder for an
element that is loading.

Create desired `rect` shapes using the [SkeletonReact tool](https://skeletonreact.com/) then pass it
as a child to the `Skeleton` component.

## Props

<PropsTable component="Skeleton" />
