Title: Avatar
description: A visual representation of a user or entity.
---

An avatar is visual representation of a user or entity.

<Demo fileName="avatar.tsx" />

## Best Practices

**When to use**

You need to visually represent a user, componany or entity.

**When not to use**

When an icon can better visually represent the content.

## Content

The avatar is designed to render an image, if the image fails to load or one is not provided,
fallback text will be rendered. Fallback text should consist of two letters to uniquely identify the
entity.

## Accessibility

When using an image for the avatar be sure to add an `alt` prop for screen readers.

## Usage

### Size

Sizes are predefined and can be adjusted via the `size` prop.

<Demo fileName="avatar-sizes.tsx" />

### Fallback

Fallback text can be readered if a `src` prop is not defined or if the image `url` does not load.

<Demo fileName="avatar-fallback.tsx" />

## Props

<PropsTable component="Avatar" />
