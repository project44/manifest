<Demo fileName="box.tsx" />

## Examples

### CSS prop

All components support a `css` prop. Itâ€™s like the `style` attribute, but it supports tokens, media
queries, nesting and token-aware values.

<Demo fileName="box-css-prop.tsx" />

### As prop

All components support a polymorphic `as` prop. This prop is useful for changing the rendering
element of a component. You can also use the as prop to render another component.

<Demo fileName="box-as-prop.tsx" />

## Props

<PropsTable component="Box" />
