# Installation

Quickly build experiences leveraging the Manifest Design System.

## Install the core package

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @project44-manifest/react react react-dom
```

## Setup fonts

Manifest Design System was designed leveraging the Inter font. Please be sure to include the font
family link in the `<head>` of your application's HTML.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

## Setup Provider

For Manifest Design System to work properly, make sure to setup the Provider at the root of your
application.

```tsx
import { Provider } from '@project44-manifest/react';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Provider>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```
