Buttons are clickable elements used for performing interface actions. When space is limited, an icon button may be used.

:::note
Buttons are not links and should not be used for navigation. Buttons _do something_, links _go somewhere_. When you want to navigate a user to another page or website, use a [link](link).

## Appearance

### Primary

Use a `primary` button variant to indicate the strongest call to action on a page. Primary buttons should appear only once per section. Not every page needs a primary button.

```jsx live
<IconButton variant="primary">
  <Add />
</IconButton>
```

### Secondary

The `secondary` button should be the default button variant for most use cases.

```jsx live
<IconButton variant="secondary">
  <Add />
</IconButton>
```

### Tertiary

Use a `tertiary` button to deprioritize actions when placed next to secondary or primary buttons. Tertiary buttons may also be used to lessen visual distraction when a multitude of similar actions are being used, or when the button exists inside an element with little spacing.

For example, a table that includes a download button in each row should use the `tertiary` variant.

```jsx live
<IconButton variant="tertiary">
  <Download />
</IconButton>
```

### Danger

The `danger` variant is used to indicate an action that is destructive and cannot be undone.

```jsx live
<IconButton variant="danger">
  <TrashCan />
</IconButton>
```

### Brand

Use a `brand` button variant for project44 specific marketing moments. This should be used sparingly.

```jsx live
<IconButton variant="brand">
  <Add />
</IconButton>
```

## States

### Disabled

Use the `isDisabled` prop to disable a button that isnâ€™t usable. Disabled buttons present a number of accessibility issues, particularly in forms, so they should be used sparingly.

```jsx live
<IconButton isDisabled>
  <Add />
</IconButton>
```

## Sizing

### Small

Set the button size to `small` when vertical spacing is limited, like inside a table row.

```jsx live
<IconButton variant="secondary" size="small">
  <Add />
</IconButton>
```

## Common configurations

### Popular icon-only buttons

Some icons have meanings that are understood universally across software experiences. For example, a trash can always conveys _delete_, where a plus symbol says _add_.

When this is true, a designer should feel empowered to rely solely on the button's icon to convey meaning.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup>
	<IconButton>
  		<Add />
	</IconButton>
	
	<IconButton variant="secondary">
  		<Download />
	</IconButton>
	
	<IconButton variant="secondary">
  		<More />
	</IconButton>
	
	<IconButton variant="danger">
  		<TrashCan />
	</IconButton>
	
	<IconButton variant="tertiary">
  		<Close />
	</IconButton>
</ButtonGroup>
```

### Overflow menu

Overflow menus give users a place to find additional relevant actions that are deprioritized enough to obscure under a dropdown menu.

Use the `More` icon to indicate an overflow menu. When space is limited or multiple overflow menus exist in one section (like a table, for example), use the `small` size and `tertiary` variant.

```jsx live
<IconButton variant="tertiary" size="small">
  <More />
</IconButton>
```

### Multiple icons

The icon button actually supports multiple icons, though there is often little point to that except for instances where we want an icon button to convey a dropdown action.

In this example, we add a `ChevronDown` icon to imply you can choose from a variety of download options.

:::note

If you want to combine a promoted action with alternative actions, use a [Button Group](button-group#combo-button).

```jsx live
<IconButton variant="secondary">
	<Download />
	<ChevronDown />
</IconButton>
```
