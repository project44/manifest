Button groups are designed to bring together buttons that are categorically related to each other. For example, you'd use a button group to group text formatting controls like Bold, Underline, and Italicize.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup variant="secondary" isAttached>
  <Button>Bold</Button>
  <Button>Underline</Button>
  <Button>Italicize</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

## Appearance

### Variants

The button group can control the variant for all buttons within the group.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup variant="secondary" size="small">
  <Button>Button</Button>
  <Button>Button</Button>
  <Button>Button</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

#### Design considerations

:::caution Do not mix styles
Do not combine variants and button types within a single group. All buttons in the same group should share the same `variant` and `size` properties.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup variant="secondary">
  <Button variant="primary" startIcon={<Filter />}>Filter</Button>
  <Button>Columns</Button>
  <IconButton><Download /></IconButton>
</ButtonGroup>
```
:::

:::warning Do not use primary variant
Do not use the `primary` button variant for button groups. There should only be one primary button per section, so we certainly wouldn't want three primary buttons next to each other.

The only exception to this rule is when you are configuring a button group to behave like a [combo button](#combo-button).
:::


### Attached

By using `isAttached`, buttons within a group can be attached to each other, creating a stronger relationship between their actions.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup variant="secondary" isAttached>
  <Button>Button</Button>
  <Button>Button</Button>
  <Button>Button</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

## States

### Disabled

Use the `isDisabled` prop to disable all buttons within that group. Disabled buttons present a number of accessibility issues, particularly in forms, so they should be used sparingly.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup variant="secondary" isDisabled>
  <Button>Button</Button>
  <Button>Button</Button>
  <Button>Button</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

## Common configurations

### Multiple groups

When you have multiple controls that can't reasonably fit into a single group, you can use multiple groups separated by a `small` gap to logically organize related functions.

In this example, one group contains similar text formating controls and the other controls related to font selection.

```jsx live
<Flex gap="small">
	<ButtonGroup variant="secondary" isAttached>
	  <Button>Bold</Button>
	  <Button>Underline</Button>
	  <Button>Italicize</Button>
	</ButtonGroup>
	
	<Button variant="secondary" endIcon={<ChevronDown />}>Font</Button>
</Flex>
```

### Combo button

By combining a Button with an Icon Button inside an attached Button Group, you can create a control that gives a promoted primary action and a dropdown for alternative actions.

In this example, we have a primary action to save changes, but a dropdown might contain alternative options like "Save as" or "Revert changes."

:::note Primary variant exception
Because this button group configuration could reasonably act as a primary CTA, you may use the `primary` button variant.
:::

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup variant="secondary" isAttached>
	<Button>Save changes</Button>
	<Dropdown>
		<IconButton><ChevronDown /></IconButton>
		<DropdownMenu>
			<DropdownItem key="save-as">Save as</DropdownItem>
			<DropdownItem key="revert">Revert changes</DropdownItem>
		</DropdownMenu>
	</Dropdown>
</ButtonGroup>
```
