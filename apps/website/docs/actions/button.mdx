Buttons are clickable elements used for performing interface actions. Button labels let users know what will happen next.

:::note
Buttons are not links and should not be used for navigation. Buttons _do something_, links _go somewhere_. When you want to navigate a user to another page or website, use a [link](link).

## Appearance

### Primary

Use a `primary` button variant to indicate the strongest call to action on a page. Primary buttons should appear only once per section. Not every page needs a primary button.


```jsx live
<Button variant="primary">Primary button</Button>
```

### Secondary

The `secondary` button should be the default button variant for most use cases.

```jsx live
<Button variant="secondary">Secondary button</Button>
```

### Tertiary

Use a `tertiary` button to deprioritize actions when placed next to secondary or primary buttons. Tertiary buttons may also be used to lessen visual distraction when a multitude of similar actions are being used, or when the button exists inside an element with little spacing.

For example, a table that includes a download button in each row should use the `tertiary` variant.

```jsx live
<Button variant="tertiary">Tertiary button</Button>
```

### Danger

The `danger` variant is used to indicate an action that is destructive and cannot be undone.

```jsx live
<Button variant="danger">Danger button</Button>
```

### Brand

Use a `brand` button variant for project44 specific marketing moments. This should be used sparingly.

```jsx live
<Button variant="brand">Brand button</Button>
```

## States

### Disabled

Use the `isDisabled` prop to disable a button that isnâ€™t usable. Disabled buttons present a number of accessibility issues, particularly in forms, so they should be used sparingly.

```jsx live
<Button isDisabled>Button</Button>
```

## Sizing

### Small

Set the button size to `small` when vertical spacing is limited, like inside a table row.

```jsx live
<Button size="small">Button</Button>
```

## Icons

### Start Icon

Use `startIcon` to include [icon](/core/icons) before the button label.

```jsx live
<Button startIcon={<Add />}>Create template</Button>
```

### End Icon

Use `endIcon` to include an [icon](/core/icons) after the button label. End icons should be used to imply _directionality_ to the button's action, like traversing pages in a table or revealing a menu under the button.

```jsx live
<Button variant="tertiary" endIcon={<ChevronRight />}>Next page</Button>
```

## Common configurations

### Dropdown button

Create a dropdown button by adding the `ChevronDown` icon at the end.

```jsx live
<Button variant="secondary" endIcon={<ChevronDown />}>Select an item</Button>
```

## Content guidelines

Button labels should be concise and predictable. A user should understand what action will take place after clicking the button. When writing labels, start with a **verb** to imply action and add context with a supportive **noun**.

### Sentence case

Use sentence case, not title case, when writing button labels. Capitalize only the first word in a string, as well as any other words that require capitalization, like proper nouns, initialisms, or acronyms.

We use sentence case because it's more conversational and makes it easier for users to distinguish between common nouns and proper nouns.

### Brevity

Don't use long, redundant button labels and avoid unnecessary articles such as "a", "an", or "the" for a more concise label.
