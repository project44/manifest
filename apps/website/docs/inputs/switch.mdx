A controlled boolean input.

```jsx live
<Switch aria-label="switch" />
```

## Usage

### Label

Pass in a `string` as a child to render a label for the switch.

```jsx live
<Switch>Label</Switch>
```

### Controlled

A switch's state can be controlled by a parent React component by setting the `isSelected` prop and
passing a handler to the `onChange` prop.

```jsx live
function ControlledExample() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(false);

  return <Switch aria-label="switch" isSelected={selected} onChange={setSelected} />;
}
```

### Disabled State

Set the `isDisabled` prop to prevent a user from selecting a switch.

```jsx live
<Switch isDisabled>Disabled</Switch>
```

## Props

<PropsTable component="Switch" />
