## Examples

### Primary

Primary buttons are used to indicate the highest priority action a user can perform.

```jsx
<Button variant="primary">Primary Button</Button>
```

### Secondary

Secondary buttons are second in priority to primary buttons and are used for important actions that aren't the primary action.

```jsx
<Button variant="secondary">Secondary Button</Button>
```

### Tertiary

Tertiary buttons are the lowest priority actions and should be used for less commonly used actions.

```jsx
<Button variant="tertiary">Tertiary Button</Button>
```

### Destructive

Destructive buttons are used to indicate an action that is destructive and cannot be undone.

```jsx
<Button variant="danger">Danger Button</Button>
```

### Brand

Brand buttons are used for project44 specific marketing moments and should be use sparingly.

```jsx
<Button variant="brand">Brand Button</Button>
```

### Small

Small buttons are used when vertical spacing is limited.

```jsx
<Button size="small">Button</Button>
```

### Start Icon

Include an icon before the button label.

```jsx
<Button startIcon={<Icon icon="delete" />}>Button</Button>
```

### End Icon

Include an icon after the button label.

```jsx
<Button endIcon={<Icon icon="send" />}>Button</Button>
```
