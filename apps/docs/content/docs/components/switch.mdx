title: Switch
description: A controlled boolean input.
---

```jsx
<Switch aria-label="switch" />
```

## Examples

### Label

Pass in a `string` as a child to render a label for the switch.

```jsx
<Switch>Label</Switch>
```

### Controlled

A switch's state can be controlled by a parent React component by setting the `isSelected` prop and
passing a handler to the `onChange` prop.

```jsx
function ControlledExample() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(false);

  const handleChange = (isSelected) => {
    setSelected(isSelected);
  };

  return <Switch aria-label="switch" isSelected={selected} onChange={handleChange} />;
}
```

### Disabled State

Set the `isDisabled` prop to prevent a user from selecting a switch.

```jsx
<Switch isDisabled>Disabled</Switch>
```

## Accessibility

### Labeling

If a visible label isn't specified, an aria-label must be provided to the switch for accessibility.
If the field is labeled by a separate element, an aria-labelledby prop must be provided using the id
of the labeling element instead.

## API

### Import

```js
import { Switch } from '@project44-manifest/react';
