description: How to contribute to Manifest Design System.
---

Currently the Design Systems Team oversees all tokens, icons, components, and pattern within the system.
We recognize that the system might not provide all the elements needed for teams to build quickly and efficiently.
Therefor Manifest supports contributions from teams outside of the core Design Systems Team.

## Ways to Contribute

1. New component or pattern.
2. Extending an existing component or pattern.
3. Adding documentation.
4. Editing documentation.

## Process

During the contribution process the Design Systems Team will partner with you to ensure that all work aligns with our core principles.

### Getting Started

1. Start by creating a new proposal on our JIRA board.
2. Review proposal with the Design Systems Team and your product team.
3. Create the pattern, component or Icon in figma and in code.
4. Review the implementation with the Design Systems Team.
5. Publish the contribution documentation.
