## Install

Add the `@project44-manifest/react` package to your project:

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

## Usage

For Manifest Design System to work properly, make sure to setup the `Provider` at the root of your
application.

```js
import { Provider } from '@project44-manifest/react';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Provider>
      <YOUR_APP_COMPONENT />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

Manifest Design System was designed leveraging the
[Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter) font. Please be sure to include the
font family link in the `<head>` of your application's HTML.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Currently Manifest Design System uses material design icons. Please be sure to include the font
family link in the `<head>` of your application's HTML.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### Theme

The Manifest Design System ships with a default theme built specifically with our design language
and tokens and is based on the [Stitches Theme Tokens](https://stitches.dev/docs/tokens).

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "colors": {},
    "space": {},
    "fontSizes": {},
    "fonts": {},
    "fontWeights": {},
    "lineHeights": {},
    "letterSpacings": {},
    "sizes": {},
    "borderWidths": {},
    "borderStyles": {},
    "radii": {},
    "shadows": {},
    "zIndices": {}
  }
}
```

For explicit values, please refer to our [tokens]() documentation.

### Styling

Manifest Design System styling is powered by [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) allowing users to
override existing component styles and the ability to create new manifest theme-aware styles for new
components.

Each Manifest component exposes a css prop that will take in a theme aware style object allowing for
easy inline component overrides.

```js
import { Button } from '@project44-manifest/react';

function MyButton() {
  return <Button css={{ borderRadius: 0 }}>My Button</Button>;
}
```
