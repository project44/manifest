## Figma

As a designer for project44 you have access to our design system figma file, if not, please reach out to helpdesk to help
get you setup with a figma account. Once you have an account checkout our [figma library](https://www.figma.com/file/2vyIjgJEhVc1spMWwkgzQ5/Manifest-Design-System).

## Usage

To use these components in your Figma file, first install the Manifest Design System library.

### Installation

In Figma, open the team library from the assets tab by clicking on the book icon.

With the library window open, you can search or browse for a team library. Search for “Manifest Design System 3.0.0”

After you’ve found the library, toggle it on to enable it. The components will be instantly available in your assets panel on the left-hand side.

As components are updated, you’ll see a message in the bottom right corner notifying you that updates are available. Clicking “Review” will allow you to see what changes were made to the components in use.

You can update individual components, or "Update All" to accept all changes and update the components in your design file to the most current version.

### Font

Manifest was designed leveraging the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter) font.
